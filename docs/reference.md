The inital idea for this project came from the medium post [**“Approximate-Predictions” Make Feature Selection Radically Faster**](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/approximate-predictions-make-feature-selection-radically-faster-0f9664877687) from [from https://medium.com/@mazzanti.sam.](https://medium.com/@mazzanti.sam).

This lead me into new ideas of potential usage (even abuse) of shapley values for machine learning models.

In this project I tried to implement the ideas left by **Samuelle** in the above post, and tried to make it easy an accessible to be used on a MLproject. Also, I tried to increase my DS skills creating a python package and also in some way to give-back to the open-source community what I have been receiving from them over the years.

The main premise about the user of this package is that you know how to create you ML models and do some cleaning of the data previously.
Please don't throw garbage into any automatic process and expect that roses will come at the end of it.

The second big premise is that you are aquatinted  with shapley values and/or getting a shapley values table from some calibration data.

I will add more resources (if i can) here to help you out:

- Shop package used for calculate shapley values [shap package](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

- Details about the Shapley Tree Explainer [shap tree explainer](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/tabular_examples/tree_based_models/Census%20income%20classification%20with%20LightGBM.html)


- Shapley value reference book [reference](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html)

- This interesting book about Shapley values [book](https://christophmolnar.com/books/shap/)
